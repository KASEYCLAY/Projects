# Reflection Time!
### What have I learned?
understaning of how to getDate/Time data console log and also DOM element to display the stactic countdown date.
### What have I implemented?
So far i have implemented the function to pull ducrrent date and time with a static target date.
### What went wrong?
I am struggling with understanding how to set a dynamic date and time along with the use of the button, I somehpome have the reference error and the endDate is not defined i need to work out how to fix this before.
### What went well?
Understanding of the time but need to work on DOM elements
### Questions I have now:
script.js:11 Uncaught ReferenceError: endDate is not defined
    at countdown (script.js:11:24)
    at HTMLButtonElement.<anonymous> (script.js:56:7)
    Im sturggling with the definition its not working!!!!!!!
### Resources I used: 
MDN, [WE3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp), Stack Overflow.
