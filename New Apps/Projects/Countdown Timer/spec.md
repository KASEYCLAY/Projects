Countdown Timer Specification
Features

    Set Target Date and Time
        Allow users to input a target date and time for the countdown.
        Pre-set a default target date and time for demonstration purposes.

    Dynamic Countdown
        Continuously calculate the remaining time (days, hours, minutes, seconds) and update it in real-time.
        Ensure the countdown stops at zero.

    User Interface
        Clean and simple layout displaying:
            Days, Hours, Minutes, Seconds left.
        Provide input fields/buttons for users to set the target event.

    Customizable Messages
        Display a custom message when the countdown ends (e.g., "The event has started!").

    Responsive Design
        Ensure the timer looks good on all device sizes, including mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Implementation Outline (in Comments)

    HTML Layout
        Create a container element to hold the entire timer.
        Add display sections for Days, Hours, Minutes, Seconds, and optional event description.
        Include input elements (e.g., date picker, time picker) for user interaction.

<!-- Container for Countdown Timer -->
<!-- Section to display time remaining: days, hours, minutes, seconds -->
<!-- Input fields/buttons to set custom target date and time -->

CSS Styling

    Use CSS for:
        Layout styling (grid/flexbox for alignment).
        Font styles and sizes for readability.
        Color scheme and visual aesthetics (e.g., digital clock theme or flat design).
    Add responsiveness using media queries for smaller devices.

JavaScript Functionality

    Initialization:
        Fetch the current date and time.
        Calculate the target event's remaining time.
    Countdown Logic:
        Use setInterval to update the timer every second.
        Calculate and display:
            Days (difference in days).
            Hours (remainder after days division).
            Minutes (remainder after hours division).
            Seconds (remainder after minutes division).
        Check for countdown completion (when time reaches zero) and handle the event.
    User Interaction:
        Add event listeners for input fields/buttons to allow setting a custom event date and time.
        Validate the input to ensure it's a future date.

// Variables for target time and current time
// Function to calculate time differences
// Event listener to capture custom date-time input
// Update UI elements dynamically with time remaining

Error Handling

    Alert users if the input date-time is invalid (e.g., in the past).
    Gracefully handle any timing errors (e.g., rounding discrepancies).

    // Check for valid inputs
    // Handle scenarios where timer reaches zero

    Enhancements (Optional)
        Add animations/transitions (e.g., flip-style timer or fading transitions).
        Include sound or notification alerts when the countdown finishes.
        Store user preferences (e.g., event date/time) in localStorage for persistence.

Potential Layout

    Top Section: Header with "Event Countdown" or a title.
    Middle Section: Timer display with large, clear digits for days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
    Bottom Section: Input controls (date-time pickers, buttons) for user interaction and setting new targets.
