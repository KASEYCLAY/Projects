### Development Brief: Random Quote Generator

#### Overview:
The goal is to create a simple and interactive **Random Quote Generator** application that displays a randomly selected inspirational quote every time the user clicks a button. This app should be functional, user-friendly, and visually engaging while adhering to JavaScript best practices.

---

### Features:

1. **Dynamic Quote Display:**
   - A section that displays one inspirational quote at a time.
   - Each quote consists of text and optionally an author's name.

2. **Random Quote Retrieval:**
   - A mechanism to randomly select and display a quote from a predefined set of quotes stored in an array or fetched from an API.

3. **Button Interaction:**
   - A prominently displayed button labeled (e.g., "Get New Quote").
   - Clicking this button triggers a random quote selection.

4. **Basic Styling:**
   - A clean and minimal UI, with styles applied for readability and visual appeal.
   - Adequate spacing, attractive font choices, and responsiveness for different screen sizes.

### Functional Details:

1. **Predefined Quote List:**
   - If using a local data source:
     - A static JavaScript array containing 10â€“20 quotes in the format:  
       `{ text: "Quote here", author: "Author here" }`.
   - If using an external API:
     - Make use of a free quote API such as `https://type.fit/api/quotes`.
     - Handle asynchronous fetching using `fetch()`.

2. **Random Selection Logic:**
   - Use JavaScript's `Math.random()` to select a random quote from the array or fetched API data.

3. **State Management:**
   - Maintain state to ensure the displayed quote updates without duplicating unnecessary DOM operations.

4. **User Feedback:**
   - Add smooth transitions or animations for a better user experience when a new quote is displayed.

5. **Error Handling (Optional):**
   - Handle network or API errors gracefully if fetching from a remote source.
   - Display a fallback message or quote if data cannot be loaded.

6. **Accessibility (a11y):**
   - Ensure the button is navigable and operable via keyboard (`Tab` and `Enter` keys).
   - Use appropriate ARIA roles for the button and dynamic content updates.

### Non-Functional Requirements:

- **Performance:**  
  - Fast page load times. Optimize by preloading quotes or caching fetched data where applicable.

- **Scalability:**  
  - Ensure the design can accommodate future enhancements like multiple categories of quotes or storing user favorites.

- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:**  
  - Test across popular browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

---

### Possible Enhancements (For Future Iteration):

1. **Social Sharing:**
   - Add a "Share" button to allow users to share the quote on platforms like Twitter or Facebook.

2. **Copy-to-Clipboard:**
   - Include a feature that allows users to copy the quote and author to their clipboard.

3. **Theme Support:**
   - Introduce light and dark mode themes to cater to user preferences.

4. **Persistent Favorites:**
   - Let users save favorite quotes and persist the data using `localStorage` or a database.

### Deliverables:

- Functional **HTML, CSS, and JS** implementation.
- A simple README documenting:
  - How the app works.
  - A brief explanation of design and technical decisions.
- Optional (if requested): Source control setup (e.g., GitHub repository).
