# What have I learned?

    I learned how to use JavaScript to make my webpage interactive.
    I learned about DOMContentLoaded to make sure my script runs after the page loads.
    I used sliders and buttons to take input from users and update things on the page.

# What have I implemented?

    A tip calculator that:
        Updates the number of people when I move the slider.
        Resets everything with a reset button.
        Checks if the user entered the right data before doing the math.

# What went wrong?

    I need to show the final tip and total on the webpage.
    I need add errors, like what happens if there are zero people.

# What went well?

    The slider works, and the number of people updates on the screen.
    The error messages make sense and help the user fix problems.

# Questions I have now or things i could do

    How can I make sure the webpage works well for people using keyboards or other tools?
    What can I do to make the form look good on phones?
    How do I handle weird cases, like someone entering really big or small numbers?

# Resources I used:

    Calculator.net: Looked at their HTML structure and changed their CSS for practice.
    W3Schools - HTML Tags: Used to learn more about HTML elements.
    MDN - JavaScript: Helped me understand JavaScript better.

# Future Goals:

    Fix the tip and total so they show up after calculations.
    Test for errors, like dividing by zero or missing inputs.
    Add small tests to make sure my calculations are always correct.

ANY NICHE PAIN POINTS!!!!!!
