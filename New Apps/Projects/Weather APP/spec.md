# Weather App Project Specification  

## Project Overview  
The goal of this project is to develop a Weather App that fetches real-time weather data from a public API and displays it to the user in an intuitive and visually appealing way. The application will utilise HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a responsive and interactive user experience.

## Features and Requirements  

### Core Features  
1. **Search Functionality**  
   - Allow users to input a city or location name and fetch weather data for that location.  
   - Display a helpful error message if the user enters an invalid location.

2. **Real-Time Weather Data**  
   - Fetch current weather information for the specified location using a public API such as OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI.  
   - Key data points to display:  
     - Temperature (Celsius/Fahrenheit toggle optional).  
     - Weather condition (e.g., Clear, Rain, Snow).  
     - Wind speed and direction.  
     - Humidity percentage.  
     - An appropriate weather icon representing the condition.

3. **Current Location Feature**  
   - Add an option to fetch the user's current location via the browser's geolocation API.  
   - Display weather data for the user's detected location.

4. **Responsive Design**  
   - Ensure that the app works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

5. **Error Handling**  
   - Handle API errors gracefully (e.g., network issues, invalid city names, API rate limits).  
   - Provide clear feedback for issues, such as an error alert or a placeholder message.

### Optional Features  
1. **5-Day Weather Forecast**  
   - Include a 5-day forecast displaying temperature trends and key conditions.  
   - Use a chart library (e.g., Chart.js) for a graphical representation of trends.

2. **UI Enhancements**  
   - Use dynamic backgrounds based on weather conditions (e.g., a sunny background for clear weather).  
   - Add animations or transitions for a polished interface.

3. **Favourite Locations**  
   - Allow users to save multiple locations for quick access in future sessions.  
   - Save favourites in local storage.

4. **Time-Based Styling**  
   - Adapt the colour theme to change based on the time of day (e.g., a darker theme for nighttime).

5. **Temperature Units Toggle**  
   - Add a toggle for Celsius and Fahrenheit to give users a choice.

## Technical Details  

### API Integration  
- **API:** Use a reliable weather API, such as [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) or [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/).  
- **API Key Management:**  
  - Ensure the API key is stored securely and not hardcoded in the source.  
  - Implement API key restrictions (e.g., limiting to specific domains).

### Front-End Stack  
1. **HTML**  
   - Provide a semantic structure for elements such as the search bar, weather details, and error messages.  
2. **CSS**  
   - Utilise modern CSS features (e.g., Flexbox or Grid) for layout.  
   - Implement CSS variables for theme management.  
   - Consider using a preprocessor like SCSS for maintainable styles (optional).  
3. **JavaScript**  
   - Fetch and display weather data dynamically using `fetch()` or Axios.  
   - Add interactivity (e.g., searching and toggling) using DOM manipulation.

## User Interface Design  

### Layout  
1. **Header**  
   - Display the appâ€™s title and optional branding.  
   - Include the search bar for querying locations.  
2. **Main Weather Display**  
   - Display current weather details prominently.  
   - Include the current date and location.  
3. **Additional Information**  
   - Show extra details such as humidity, wind speed, and forecast (if included).  
4. **Footer**  
   - Provide attribution for the API and developer (e.g., "Powered by OpenWeatherMap").

### Styling & Accessibility  
- Ensure high contrast and readability for all elements.  
- Implement proper ARIA roles for accessibility.  
- Add focus states for keyboard navigability.

## Non-Functional Requirements  

1. **Performance**  
   - Minimise API calls by caching recent queries (e.g., using session storage or a timeout-based system).  
   - Optimise images and assets for faster load times.  
2. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**  
   - Test on all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).  
3. **Scalability**  
   - Ensure the codebase is modular to allow for future enhancements or API changes.

## Development and Testing  

### Tools  
- **Version Control:** Use Git for version tracking and collaboration.  
- **Testing:**  
   - Functional Testing: Verify search, error handling, and API integration.  
   - Responsive Testing: Use tools like Chrome DevTools to verify mobile compatibility.  
   - Cross-Browser Testing: Ensure consistent behaviour across browsers.

## Delivery Milestones  

1. **Phase 1: Basic Weather Display**  
   - Set up API integration and show current weather details for a queried location.  

2. **Phase 2: Core Features**  
   - Implement geolocation and responsive design.  

3. **Phase 3: Optional Features**  
   - Add enhancements like forecasts, dynamic backgrounds, or favourites if time allows.
